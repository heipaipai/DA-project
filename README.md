# DA-project

Author: heipaipai

Project status: incomplete, on hiatus

## Introduction

A project made for Data Analytics module (5 ECTS) in Munster Technological University, Kerry, Computing department in autumn semester 2022.
Uses the K9 file from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/p53+Mutants to practice cleaning up datasets.
Aims to provide a clean, easier-for-humans-to-understand dataset for further study.
A non-informal introduction to p53 was added for the module teacher (and current reader) to understand the subject.
Further information & references in the file.

## Technologies

This project uses Python 3.8.5 with some of its libraries: numpy, pandas, sklearn, math, matplotlib and seaborn. The main data analytics library used was pandas.
Please note that this is my first attempt with anything Python and most things data analytic.


## Other information

### Still missing
- proper in-text referencing (MTU uses Harvard Anglia Ruskin)
- execution of a viable method to reduce dimensionality - PCA just doesn't cut it
- proper visualisation
